In this sorting project using java, I was tasked to create my own Directed Graph and performing the Topological Sort Algorithm
on the graph. I tested basic functionality by creating nodes, adding edges, etc.
This project implements a Directed Graph with essential operations such as adding/removing nodes and edges, counting elements, and performing a Topological Sort. 
The graph structure is flexible, allowing custom implementations of nodes and edges. The core functionality is defined in  GraphImpl.java, with the topoSort() method being the primary focus.
